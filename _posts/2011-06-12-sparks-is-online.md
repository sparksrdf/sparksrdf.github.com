The Sparks Website is finally online. The website is hosted on [Github](http://github.com).
We also pushed some code to [our repository](http://github.com/sparksrdf/sparks). The initial code includes everything you need for starting to use the sparks filtering framework: [Prism](http://sparksrdf.github.com/prism).

If you have any questions, fell free to [contact us](http://sparksrdf.github.com/contact). And remember to follow us on twitter [@sparksrdf](http://twitter.com/sparksrdf).
