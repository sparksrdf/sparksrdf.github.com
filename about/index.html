<h2>History</h2> 
<p>The work on Sparks started in 2009 while working on the <a href="http://www.weknowit.eu/">WeKnowIt european project</a>. The sparks development begun as a join effort between Gregoire Burel and Amparo E. Cano as a mean for augmenting web documents through Semantic Overlays. The resulting work, the Ozone browser <a href="http://evhart.online.fr/index.php/2009/09/04/sparks-arrives-2nd-at-eswc09-challenge">won an award</a> at the ESWC2009 conference.</p> 
<p>As the work on WeKnowIt was requiring a mechanism for visualising a large set of RDF data, it was necessary to create a new library for filtering such data. This work lead to the creation of the Prism library that was used in the  <a href="http://nebula.dcs.shef.ac.uk/WeKnowIt">WeKnowIt demonstrator</a> and the <a href="http://nebula.dcs.shef.ac.uk/sparks/topica">Topica application</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2011, the WeKnowIt project came to an end. In this context, it was chosen to rewrite completely the libraries in a modular fashion so they could be used by other developers.
</p>

<h2>Current Development</h2> 
<p>
As the Sparks and the related JavaScript code base was gaining more functionalities such, the code was becoming hard to reuse. In this context, It was decided to rewrite from scratch all the JavaScript components in a more modular fashion under the Sparks umbrella.
</p> 
<p>
The current development, is focusing on rewriting the Prism library on adding new functionalities such as RDF ORM functionalities. The current code is maintained by Gregoire Burel.
